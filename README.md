# Anthony Caron - Portfolio Website
This is a portfolio website developed for myself. It was developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

## Hosting
The site is hosted publicly at https://www.anthonycaron.com/.

## Local Installation
This site is build with GatsbyJS, so you'll need to have the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/) installed on your machine. You can install the Gatsby CLI with:

```shell
# install the Gatsby CLI globally
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

You can then clone this repo, and use Gatsby to run this site locally (found at http://localhost:8000/ by default).

```shell
# clone this repo

git clone https://github.com/antcar112/anthony-caron-portfolio.git

# navigate into this repo
cd ./anthony-caron-portfolio

# install dependencies
npm i

# run this site locally
gatsby develop
```
